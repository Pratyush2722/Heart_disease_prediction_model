# Heart_disease_prediction_model
This model is used using logistic regression and showcases its capability to predict the heart disease if the values from the report are given as input
Heart Disease Prediction

📑 Description

This project uses a Machine Learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes. The model is built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🚀 Features

Data loading and preprocessing

Model training using Logistic Regression

Model evaluation with accuracy score

Predicting heart disease using new data

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is heart_disease_data.csv, which contains medical attributes related to heart health.

⚙️ How to Run

Clone this repository.

Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

💡 Usage

The model predicts whether a person has heart disease based on input features. It outputs:

"The person doesn't have heart disease" if the prediction is 0.

"The person has heart disease" if the prediction is 1.

🧠 Model

Model used: Logistic Regression

Evaluation metric: Accuracy Score

📊 Example

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("The person doesn't have heart disease")
else:
    print("The person has heart disease")

📈 Results

The model achieves a good accuracy score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
